      "**\"Causal Inference for the Brave and True\"** - An open-source educational material on causal inference and the statistics of science, written by Matheus Facure Alves. The book uses free software and Python, aiming to be accessible both monetarily and intellectually.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Main Content Focus**\n",
      "The documents focus on **Chapter 07: Beyond Confounders**, which explores the nuanced topic of variable selection in causal inference models. The key themes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **1. Good Controls**\n",
      "- Adding controls to regression models helps identify causal effects\n",
      "- Variables that are good predictors of the outcome should be included, even if they don't predict the treatment\n",
      "- This reduces variance and increases the likelihood of finding statistically significant results\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Mostly Harmful Controls**\n",
      "- Adding variables that predict only the treatment (but not the outcome) is counterproductive\n",
      "- These variables reduce treatment variability, making it harder to identify causal effects\n",
      "- In the big data era, blindly adding 1000+ variables is unnecessary and detrimental\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Bad Controls - Selection Bias**\n",
      "- Selection bias occurs when controlling for variables that are:\n",
      "  - In the causal path between treatment and outcome (mediators)\n",
      "  - Common effects of both treatment and outcome\n",
      "- This bias can occur even in randomized experiments\n",
      "- Examples include filtering for participants only or adding dummies for outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
      "The document emphasizes a practical rule: **Always include confounders and good predictors of the outcome; always exclude variables that only predict treatment, mediators, or common effects.**\n",

      "\n",
      "Selection bias occurs when you **control for (include in your model) a variable that is either:**\n",
      "1. **A mediator** - a variable that lies in the causal path between treatment and outcome (T → X → Y)\n",
      "2. **A collider/common effect** - a variable that is caused by both the treatment and the outcome (T → X ← Y)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is fundamentally different from **confounding bias**, which comes from failing to control for a common cause (X → T and X → Y).\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Why is Selection Bias So Dangerous?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The document emphasizes several critical points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **It's Pervasive and Hard to Spot** - Selection bias is so common that it's often introduced by well-intentioned but misguided practices. It appears \"underneath some supposedly clever idea, making it even harder to uncover.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Randomization Cannot Fix It** - Unlike confounding bias, which randomization can eliminate, selection bias can occur **even in perfectly randomized experiments**. This is crucial: having random assignment doesn't protect you from selection bias if you control for the wrong variables.\n",

      "### **Real-World Examples from the Document**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Example 1: Hospital Treatment Study**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Setup:**\n",
      "- Patients are randomly assigned to treatment (drug) or control (placebo)\n",
      "- Outcome: days in hospital\n",
      "- Variables: treatment, severity, hospital\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Problem:**\n",
      "When you run a simple regression of days on treatment, you get a **positive coefficient** (treatment increases hospital days). This seems counterintuitive!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This Happens:**\n",
      "- Severity causes both hospital assignment AND days in hospital\n",
      "- Hospital 1 treats more severe cases and gives 90% drug\n",
      "- Hospital 2 treats less severe cases and gives 10% drug\n",
      "- When you look at both hospitals together, the untreated group has more patients from Hospital 2 (less severe), making them appear to have better outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Causal Graph:**\n",
      "```\n",
      "Severity → Hospital → Treatment\n",
      "   ↓\n",
      "  Days\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Solution:**\n",
      "Control for severity (the confounder), NOT hospital. Once you control for severity, hospital becomes irrelevant because it no longer predicts the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What NOT to do:**\n",
      "If you control for hospital (which only causes treatment, not the outcome), you introduce selection bias and get a biased estimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Example 2: Collections Email Campaign**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Setup:**\n",
      "- Email is randomly assigned to customers\n",
      "- Outcome: payments made\n",
      "- Variables: email, opened, agreement, credit_limit, risk_score\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Causal Chain:**\n",
      "```\n",
      "Email → Opened → Agreement → Payments\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Problem:**\n",
      "If you control for \"opened\" or \"agreement\" in your model, you introduce selection bias because:\n",
      "- These variables are **caused by** the treatment (email)\n",
      "- They lie in the causal path from treatment to outcome\n",
      "- Controlling for them blocks the effect of email on payments\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This Matters:**\n",
      "- You can't open an email you didn't receive\n",
      "- Agreement only counts negotiations that happened AFTER the email was sent\n",
      "- These are mediators, not confounders\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Example 3: Debt Payment Dummy (COP - Conditional on Participation)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Problem:**\n",
      "When estimating the effect of a collections strategy on payments, researchers sometimes add a dummy variable for \"paying the entire debt\" or filter to only include customers who made any payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This Introduces Bias:**\n",
      "When you filter to only customers who paid (Y > 0), you're conditioning on the outcome. This creates a selection problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mathematical Breakdown:**\n",
      "The document shows:\n",
      "```\n",
      "E[Y|Y>0, T=1] - E[Y|Y>0, T=0] = Causal Effect + Selection Bias\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- **Causal Effect** = E[Y₁ - Y₀ | Y₁ > 0] (effect on those who would participate)\n",
      "- **Selection Bias** = E[Y₀ | Y₁ > 0] - E[Y₀ | Y₀ > 0]\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Intuition:**\n",
      "- Customers who pay when treated might be different from those who pay without treatment\n",
      "- Rich customers pay regardless of treatment\n",
      "- Frugal customers only pay if treated\n",
      "- When you filter to only payers, you're comparing \"rich + frugal\" (treated) vs \"rich only\" (untreated)\n",
      "- This creates a negative bias because rich customers spend more than frugal ones\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **The Golden Rule**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Always:**\n",
      "- ✅ Include confounders (common causes of T and Y)\n",
      "- ✅ Include good predictors of the outcome Y (even if they don't predict T)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Never:**\n",
      "- ❌ Control for mediators (variables in the causal path T → X → Y)\n",
      "- ❌ Control for colliders/common effects (variables caused by both T and Y)\n",
      "- ❌ Control for variables that only predict T but not Y\n",
      "- ❌ Filter or condition on the outcome\n",

      "\n",
      "Selection bias is one of the most insidious problems in causal inference because:\n",
      "1. It can occur even with perfect randomization\n",
      "2. It's often introduced by seemingly reasonable practices\n",
      "3. It requires understanding causal graphs and variable relationships\n",
      "4. The solution is NOT to add more controls, but to be strategic about which variables to include\n",
      "\n",
      "The best defense is to **think carefully about your causal graph before running any analysis** and ask: \"Does this variable cause the treatment, the outcome, or both?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For variables X, Y, and stratifying variable Z:\n",
